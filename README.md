# Thank you.

I hope you like what I did. :)

There's a link live [here.](https://Metwesh.github.io/sideup-ui-challenge)

If I had more time, I would've made the mobile dash page more modular & used more breakpoints in order to make the site truly responsive.

P.S When changing screen sizes kindly refresh the page, because some charts don't show on resize.
